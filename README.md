# UK-road-accidents-investigation
A quick exploration of accidents on British roads

Growing up in the UK I have always had an appreciation for the country road. Seamlessly never ending winding roads, some with high hedge rows making viewing around the next corner sometimes a guessing a game. I know over the last decade, the UK has tried to improve road safety and when discovering this data set, I was intrigued to see how far they have come.

I found this dataset on Kaggle.com, but it is an opensource data available from https://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data.
The dataset covers all reported road accidents from 2005 to 2015 providing 33 different parameters related to each accident, including information about the casualties, roads, geolocation, speed information, police authorities, and many more. I have done a deep dive into some of the main points of interest, such as, geolocation and accident counts, which are the most dangerous roads and junctions. Furthermore, I have explored the evolution of accidents over time and use seasonal ARIMA modeling to predict future events. Moreover, I have used Logistic regression and Random Forest models to predict if various input paramters can classify if an accident is more likely to occur in an urban of rural environment.

There is a jupyter notebook file available, but it is also summarized in html format. There are also two other html files containing junction accident counts.
